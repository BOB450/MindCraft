This is a work in progress minecraft clone: to get it to work you will need to downloade the bdcraft texture pack and put it in the assets file
inside the BDCraft zip you will find a folder called assets this should be renamed PureBDcraft and placed in this projects assets folder
the DBCraft pack can be found [here](https://bdcraft.net/) you need to use the 1.19.4 version or they will want you to be a sponser
